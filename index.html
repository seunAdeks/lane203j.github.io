<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I'm a research mathematician with a background in programming and computer science that 
goes back to my early undergraduate days as an electronics systems engineering student, and 
  more recently, scientific programmming as part of my academic research.</p>

<h1>Github projects</h1>
<a href="https://github.com/lane203j/deep-autoencoder-with-RBM-pretraining">
  <h2>Deep autoencoders and restricted Boltzmann machines</h2></a>

<p>In this project I am reproducing results from the paper "Reducing the Dimensionality 
of Data with Neural Networks" by Hinton and Salakhutdinov. My code implements a restricted Boltzmann machine, 
  pretrains a deep autoencoder using RBM's, then loads the weights into a Keras model for fine tuning.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a MNIST 
  digit reproduced by the RBM after 10 epochs of training:</p>

<a href="https://github.com/lane203j/MNIST-GAN"><h2>Generative adversarial networks</h2></a>

<p>A generative adversarial network for generating hand-drawn digits, trained on MNIST using Docker and AWS EC2.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/lane203j/Hofer-Zehnder-Estimates"><h2>Estimating Hofer-Zehnder capacities</h2></a>

<p>A constrained gradient-descent algorithm (with non-linear constraints, using projected gradients) 
  written in python with NumPy and SciPy.</p>
