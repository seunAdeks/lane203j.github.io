title: Animated heatmap of crime rates in Chicago
---

I created an animated heatmap that shows crime rates by location in Chicago, from 2001 to 2004. 

![Crime in Chicago|50%]({{ "/images/anim.gif" | absolute_url }})    ![Retreived from Bing|50%]({{ "/images/chicago.png" | absolute_url }})

This was created using data made publically available by City of Chicago and the Chicago Police Department. The python script used to create this image from the data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/lane203j/animated-heat-map-of-crime-in-chicago-2001-2004).
