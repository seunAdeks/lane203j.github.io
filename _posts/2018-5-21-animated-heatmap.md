An animated heatmap created with matplotlib that shows crime rates by location in Chicago, from 2001 to 2017. 

![Crime in Chicago]({{ "/images/anim.gif" | absolute_url }})    

This was created using data made publically available by City of Chicago and the Chicago Police Department. The python script used to create this image from the data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/lane203j/animated-heat-map-of-crime-in-chicago-2001-2004).
