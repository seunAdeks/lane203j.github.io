<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I'm a research mathematician with a background in programming and computer science. I'm interested in transitioning to a career in machine learning with a research component.</p> 

<h1>Mathematics research</h1>

<p>My mathematics research studies an intersection between dynamical systems, topology, and differential geometry (at a basic level, 
  the tools I rely on boil down to analysis and linear algebra). Recently, I have been studying connections between Gelfand-Zeitlin systems and the exciting field of 
  tropical geometry. You can read more about it on my <a href = "http://www.unige.ch/~lanej/">University of Geneva department webpage.</a> 
  </p>

<h1>Github projects</h1>
<a href="https://github.com/lane203j/deep-autoencoder-with-RBM-pretraining">
  <h2>Deep autoencoders and restricted Boltzmann machines</h2></a>

<p>Restricted Boltzmann machines and pretrained deep autoencoders for generation, classification and cluster analysis.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/lane203j/MNIST-GAN"><h2>Generative adversarial networks</h2></a>

<p>A generative adversarial network image generation.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/lane203j/Hofer-Zehnder-Estimates"><h2>Estimating Hofer-Zehnder capacities</h2></a>

<p>A constrained gradient-descent algorithm (with non-linear constraints, using projected gradients) 
  that estimates the Hofer-Zhender capacities of convex bodies.</p>
