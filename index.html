<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I'm a research mathematician with a background in programming and computer science. Over the past year, I've become passionate about the  
  impacts that deep learning can have on society.</p> 

<h1>Github projects</h1>
<a href="https://github.com/lane203j/deep-autoencoder-with-RBM-pretraining">
  <h2>Deep autoencoders and restricted Boltzmann machines</h2></a>

<p>In this project I am reproducing results from the paper "Reducing the Dimensionality 
of Data with Neural Networks" by Hinton and Salakhutdinov. My code implements a restricted Boltzmann machine, 
  pretrains a deep autoencoder using RBM's, then loads the weights into a Keras model for fine tuning.</p>

<p>Here is a MNIST digit that was generated by the decoder/generator from random noise after 
  pretraining for 15 epochs and fine-tuning for 40 epochs:</p>

<a href="https://github.com/lane203j/MNIST-GAN"><h2>Generative adversarial networks</h2></a>

<p>A generative adversarial network for generating hand-drawn digits, trained on MNIST using Docker and AWS EC2.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/lane203j/Hofer-Zehnder-Estimates"><h2>Estimating Hofer-Zehnder capacities</h2></a>

<p>A constrained gradient-descent algorithm (with non-linear constraints, using projected gradients) 
  written in python with NumPy and SciPy.</p>


<h1>Mathematics research</h1>

<p>My mathematics research studies an intersection between dynamical systems, topology, and differential geometry (at a basic level, 
  the tools I rely on boil down to analysis and linear algebra). Recently, I have been studying connections between Gelfand-Zeitlin systems and the exciting field of 
  tropical geometry. You can read more about it on my <a href = "http://www.unige.ch/~lanej/">University of Geneva department webpage.</a>
